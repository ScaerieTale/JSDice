# Virtual Dice: JavaScript Edition!
I made Virtual Dice once before using Python, which waas super easy to spin up, barely an inconvenience, but good lord, getting that into a TKinter or better app turned out to be a bit of a nightmare.  So I decided to learn Javascript instead.

It's nothing too fancy, yet.  It just calls a roll() function that passes the specific dice type as a number,
and then uses Math.random to generate a result, clean it up, and spit it out on the page.

Future releases will probably come in the form of a React web application.

# WHAT IT DOES
Select from 1d2, 3, or the standard d20 dice up through 1d100.
The result will appear on the right of the website.

NOTE: I don't know how this will perform on mobile yet.  I will try and update the CSS for y'all to be easier to use if it turns out ht's difficult to use.  Reach out to me on Twitter at [@Scaerietale](https://www.twitter.com/ScaerieTale) to let me know!
